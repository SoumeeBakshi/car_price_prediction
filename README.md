# Car Price Prediction 🚗💰

This project predicts the **selling price of cars** using **Machine Learning**. The primary model used is **Linear Regression**for feature selection and regularization.  

## 📌 Project Overview
- Data preprocessing and cleaning using **pandas**
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) with **seaborn** and **matplotlib**
- Model training using **Linear Regression** from **scikit-learn**
- Model evaluation with **R² Score**

## ⚙️ Libraries Used
- **pandas** → data handling and preprocessing  
- **seaborn** → statistical data visualization  
- **matplotlib** → data visualization  
- **scikit-learn** → model building and evaluation (Linear Regression, Lasso, train-test split, metrics)  



## 📊 Results
- Linear Regression provides a baseline prediction model  
- Lasso Regression improves feature selection and reduces overfitting  
- Visualizations show strong correlations between key features and car prices  

## ✨ Future Work
- Experiment with advanced models like **Random Forest** and **XGBoost**  
- Deploy as a **Streamlit/Flask web app** for user interaction  
- Hyperparameter tuning with GridSearchCV
